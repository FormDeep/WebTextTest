    <string name="t201901">Financial regulators in Britain have imposed a rather unusual rule on the bosses
of big banks. Starting next year, any guaranteed bonus of top executives could be
delayed 10 years if their banks are under investigation for wrongdoing. The main
purpose of this “clawback” rule is to hold bankers accountable for harmful risk-taking
and to restore public trust in financial institutions. Yet officials also hope for a much
larger benefit: more long-term decision-making, not only by banks but by all
corporations, to build a stronger economy for future generations.
“Short-termism” or the desire for quick profits, has worsened in publicly traded
companies, says the Bank of England’s top economist, Andrew Haldane. He quotes a
giant of classical economics, Alfred Marshall, in describing this financial impatience
as acting like “children who pick the plums out of their pudding to eat them at once”
rather than putting them aside to be eaten last.
The average time for holding a stock in both the United States and Britain, he
notes, has dropped from seven years to seven months in recent decades. Transient
investors, who demand high quarterly profits from companies, can hinder a firm’s
efforts to invest in long-term research or to build up customer loyalty. This has been
dubbed “quarterly capitalism.”
In addition, new digital technologies have allowed more rapid trading of equities,
quicker use of information, and thus shorter attention spans in financial markets.
“There seems to be a predominance of short-term thinking at the expense of long-
term investing,” said Commissioner Daniel Gallagher of the US Securities and
Exchange Commission in a speech this week.
In the US, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has pushed most public companies to
defer performance bonuses for senior executives by about a year, slightly helping
reduce “short-termism.” In its latest survey of CEO pay, The Wall Street Journal finds
that “a substantial part” of executive pay is now tied to performance.
Much more could be done to encourage “long-termism,” such as changes in the
tax code and quicker disclosure of stock acquisitions. In France, shareholders who
hold onto a company investment for at least two years can sometimes earn more
voting rights in a company.
Within companies, the right compensation design can provide incentives for
executives to think beyond their own time at the company and on behalf of all
stakeholders. Britain’s new rule is a reminder to bankers that society has an interest in
their performance, not just for the short term but for the long term.</string>
    <string name="t201902">Grade inflation – the gradual increase in average GPAs (grade-point averages)
over the past few decades – is often considered a product of a consumer era in higher
education, in which students are treated like customers to be pleased. But another,
related force – a policy often buried deep in course catalogs called “grade
forgiveness” – is helping raise GPAs.
Grade forgiveness allows students to retake a course in which they received a
low grade, and the most recent grade or the highest grade is the only one that counts
in calculating a student’s overall GPA.
The use of this little-known practice has accelerated in recent years, as colleges
continue to do their utmost to keep students in school (and paying tuition) and
improve their graduation rates. When this practice first started decades ago, it was
usually limited to freshmen, to give them a second chance to take a class in their first
year if they struggled in their transition to college-level courses. But now most
colleges, save for many selective campuses, allow all undergraduates, and even
graduate students, to get their low grades forgiven.
College officials tend to emphasize that the goal of grade forgiveness is less
about the grade itself and more about encouraging students to retake courses critical
to their degree program and graduation without incurring a big penalty. “Ultimately,”
said Jack Miner, Ohio State University’s registrar, “we see students achieve more
success because they retake a course and do better in subsequent courses or master
the content that allows them to graduate on time.”
That said, there is a way in which grade forgiveness satisfies colleges’ own needs as
well. For public institutions, state funds are sometimes tied partly to their success on metrics
such as graduation rates and student retention – so better grades can, by boosting figures
like those, mean more money. And anything that raises GPAs will likely make
students – who, at the end of the day, are paying the bill – feel they’ve gotten a better value
for their tuition dollars, which is another big concern for colleges.
Indeed, grade forgiveness is just another way that universities are responding to
consumers’ expectations for higher education. Since students and parents expect a
college degree to lead to a job, it is in the best interest of a school to turn out
graduates who are as qualified as possible – or at least appear to be. On this, students’
and colleges’ incentives seem to be aligned.</string>
